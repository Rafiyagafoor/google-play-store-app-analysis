## Machine Learning Implementation
 Objective
Predict the **number of installs** for a Google Play Store application.

 Features Used:
- Rating  
- Reviews  
- Price  

 Models Applied:
- **Multiple Linear Regression** (Baseline Model)  
- **Random Forest Regressor** (Comparison Model)  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- R² Score  

Random Forest Regressor achieved better performance compared to Multiple Linear Regression.
## Conclusion
This project analyzed the Google Play Store dataset using exploratory data analysis and machine learning. Ratings, reviews, and price were identified as important factors affecting app installs. Multiple Linear Regression was used as a baseline model, and Random Forest Regressor achieved better prediction accuracy. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to extract insights and make reliable predictions from real-world data.
